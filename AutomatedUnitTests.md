Runners intended for use with NUnit 2.x will not run NUnit 3 tests correctly.

* MSTest (Visual Studio Test) - This is MSTest V2, the evolution of Microsoft's Test Framework.
To discover and execute tests install MSTest.TestAdapter. 
To discover and execute tests for project.json based projects install dotnet-test-mstest.

* xUnit.net - is a free, open source, community-focused unit testing tool for the .NET Framework. Written by the original inventor of NUnit v2, xUnit.net is the latest technology for unit testing C#, F#, VB.NET and other .NET languages. xUnit.net works with ReSharper, CodeRush, TestDriven.NET and Xamarin.

* mb-unit - The Gallio Automation Platform is an open, extensible, and neutral system for .NET that provides a common object model, runtime services and tools (such as test runners) that may be leveraged by any number of test frameworks.
MbUnit is an extensible unit testing framework for the .NET Framework that takes in and goes beyond xUnit pattern testing. MbUnit is part of the Gallio bundle.

* Ncover - Code Coverage tool

* OpenCover - A code coverage tool for .NET 2 and above (WINDOWS OS only), support for 32 and 64 processes with both branch and sequence points 

* XMLUnit - Unit Testing XML for Java and .NET http://www.xmlunit.org/

### Java 
* XMLUnit - Unit Testing XML for Java and .NET http://www.xmlunit.org/

* Junit - The new major version of the programmer-friendly testing framework for Java 8 JUnit 5 is the next generation of JUnit. The goal is to create an up-to-date foundation for developer-side testing on the JVM. This includes focusing on Java 8 and above, as well as enabling many different styles of testing.http://junit.org/junit5/

* TestNG - TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use http://testng.org/doc/ 

* test-data-supplier - Extended TestNG DataProvider https://github.com/sskorol/test-data-supplier

### Python 
* unittest - The unittest unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework. htps://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html

* unittest2 - unittest2 is a backport of the new features added to the unittest testing framework in Python 2.7 and onwards. It is tested to run on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and pypy. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unittest2

* pytest - The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries. https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/

* nose - nose extends unittest to make testing easier.https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

* slash - Slash is a testing framework written in Python, intended for testing large scale projects, especially in integration scenarios. Slash focuses on customization and extensibility, allow you to tailor the framework for your specific needs, making it your testing framework. https://github.com/getslash/slash

* Proboscis - Proboscis is a Python test framework that extends Python’s built-in unittest module and Nose with features from TestNG. https://pythonhosted.org/proboscis/

* Trial - Trial is Twisted's unit testing system, an extension of ​Python's `unittest` module.
Trial is two things. The first is a command-line test runner, which can be run on plain Python unit tests. It's very simple to use http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedTrial

* subunit - Subunit is a streaming protocol for test results. The protocol is a binary encoding that is easily generated and parsed. By design all the components of the protocol conceptually fit into the xUnit TestCase->TestResult interaction. https://launchpad.net/subunit

* Pythoscope - Pythoscope is a unit test generator for programs written in Python. http://pythoscope.org/

* dutest - An object-oriented API to test doctests using unittest runners. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dutest
