### C# 
* Newtonsoft.Json - Json.NET is a popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/

* RestSharp - Simple REST and HTTP API Client https://www.nuget.org/packages/RestSharp/

### Java 
* Selenified - The Selenified Test Framework provides mechanisms for simply testing applications at multiple tiers while easily integrating into DevOps build environments. Selenified provides traceable reporting for both web and API testing, wraps and extends Selenium calls to more appropriately handle testing errors, and supports testing over multiple browser https://github.com/Coveros/selenified

* WireMock - Mock your APIs for fast, robust and comprehensive testing
WireMock is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs. Some might consider it a service virtualization tool or a mock server. http://wiremock.org/

* rest-assured - Java DSL for easy testing of REST services https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured

* MockServer - MockServer can be used for mocking any system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS (i.e. services, web sites, etc).http://www.mock-server.com/

* karate - Web-Services Testing Made Simple. Karate enables you to script a sequence of calls to any kind of web-service and assert that the responses are as expected. It makes it really easy to build complex request payloads, traverse data within the responses, and chain data from responses into the next request. Karate's payload validation engine can perform a 'smart compare' of two JSON or XML documents without being affected by white-space or the order in which data-elements actually appear, and you can opt to ignore fields that you choose.https://github.com/intuit/karate

* Awaitility - Testing asynchronous systems is hard. Not only does it require handling threads, timeouts and concurrency issues, but the intent of the test code can be obscured by all these details. Awaitility is a DSL that allows you to express expectations of an asynchronous system in a concise and easy to read manner.

### JavaScript 
* Postman BDD - The Postman REST client allows you to write tests for your APIs, such as ensuring that your endpoints return the proper HTTP status codes, headers, and content. It even has has a built-in test runner that makes it easy to run all of your tests and immediately see the results. And you can use the Newman command-line tool to automate your tests and integrate them into your CI and deployment pipeline. https://www.npmjs.com/package/postman-bdd

### Python 
* Selenium Requests - Extends Selenium WebDriver classes to include the request function from the Requests library, while doing all the needed cookie and request headers handling. https://github.com/cryzed/Selenium-Requests

* selenium-respectful - Minimalist Selenium WebDriver wrapper to work within rate limits of any amount of websites simultaneously. Parallel processing friendly. https://github.com/SerpentAI/selenium-respectful

* mock - Rolling backport of unittest.mock for all Pythons https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock

* ludibrio - Platform for test doubles in Python (mocks, stubs, Spy, and dummies) https://github.com/nsigustavo/ludibrio/

* responses - A utility for mocking out the Python Requests library. https://github.com/getsentry/responses

* doublex - Powerful test doubles framework for Python https://pypi.python.org/pypi/doublex

* freezegun - Let your Python tests travel through time https://github.com/spulec/freezegun

* pretenders - Fake servers for testing http://pretenders.readthedocs.org/ https://github.com/pretenders/pretenders

* mock-server - Simple mock server for REST API http://tomashanacek.github.com/mock-s… https://github.com/tomashanacek/mock-server 

* vcrpy - Automatically mock your HTTP interactions to simplify and speed up testing https://github.com/kevin1024/vcrpy

* Rester - Framework for testing (RESTful) HTTP APIs
Rester allows you to test your APIs using a non-programmatic or non-GUI based approach, which are some of the more conventional ways of testing RESTFul APIs. Rester is inspired by various unit testing frameworks like JUnit, 'unittest' (python) etc and is conceptually organized like those frameworks, but is geared towards testing RESTful API endpoints. With Rester, all tests are specified in YAML or JSON. https://github.com/chitamoor/rester

* pyresttest- Python Rest Testing https://github.com/svanoort/pyresttest

* siesta - Sit back, relax and enjoy your REST client for python http://scastillo.github.com/siesta https://github.com/scastillo/siesta

### Ruby 
* active_mocker - Generate mocks from ActiveRecord models for unit tests that run fast because they don’t need to load Rails or a database. http://dustinzeisler.com/active_mocker/ https://github.com/zeisler/active_mocker

* test_xml - Small library to test your xml with Test::Unit or RSpec https://github.com/alovak/test_xml

* webmock - Library for stubbing and setting expectations on HTTP requests in Ruby.

* vcr - Record your test suite's HTTP interactions and replay them during future test runs for fast, deterministic, accurate tests. http://relishapp.com/vcr/vcr https://github.com/vcr/vcr
